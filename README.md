### Welcome to my blank space! ðŸ‘‹

I usually prefer to use Java and Python, now I am learning C++.

I hate involution, but there is nothing I can do, I can only hope that I become better.

Those who can't come to the best of their ambitions can have no regrets. Who can ridicule them?

I hope I can finally get a good offer!

Itâ€™s worth mentioning that I donâ€™t play LOL, but I like the IG and the K/DA very much.
