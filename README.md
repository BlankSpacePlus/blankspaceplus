I studied software engineering during my undergraduate course.

In the use of programming languages, I am good at Java, and I often use C, C++, Python and other languages.

At present, I have won the first prize of the 11th Lanqiao Cup Provincial Level, and the national competition has not yet come out.

If there is a will, things will happen. Hope all efforts will have a good result!
